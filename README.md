# stm-hardware

## Commands
The stm expects the following command formats to move the robot. The number after the forward & backward move commands are in centimeter. So, a number of 120 means 120cm. All the turn commands will execute a 90Â° turn.

```
FORWARD MOVE 120
BACKWARD MOVE 120
FORWARD TURN RIGHT
FORWARD TURN LEFT
BACKWARD TURN RIGHT
BACKWARD TURN LEFT
```
